### Data Used for Bioinformatic Project 
The following eight steno phages were downloaded from NCBI: [MG189906.1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MG189906), [KR560069.1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/KR560069), [MK903280.1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MK903280), [NC_049463.1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_049463.1), [NC_023588.1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_023588.1), [NC_019416.1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_019416.1), [NC_048802.1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_048802.1), [NC_048804.1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_048804.1). This Data was obtained in compressed (gzip)fasta format and placed into the raw data directory for further processing. The data was unziped and with the use of the Prokka Program was changed into general feature format (gff).
