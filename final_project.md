## Methods
### Data Used for Bioinformatic Project 
The following eight steno phages were downloaded from NCBI: [MG189906.1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MG189906), [KR560069.1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/KR560069), [MK903280.1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MK903280), [NC_049463.1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_049463.1), [NC_023588.1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_023588.1), [NC_019416.1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_019416.1), [NC_048802.1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_048802.1), [NC_048804.1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_048804.1). This data was obtained in compressed (gzip) fasta format and placed into the raw data directory for further processing. The data was unziped and processed into a general feature format (gff) with the use of Prokka Program. Prokka is a program that rapidly annotates bacterial, archaeal and viral genomes by identifying important features in the DNA sequence and labeling them with useful information [1]. General feature format is a format that produces tab deliminated fields by line and is the require input file type for the Roary program. All gff files were labeled with the steno phage identifier from NCBI and placed into a GFF directory (Figure 1).
