# Final Project

## Methods
### Data Used for Bioinformatic Project 
The following eight steno phages were downloaded from NCBI: [MG189906.1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MG189906), [KR560069.1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/KR560069), [MK903280.1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MK903280), [NC_049463.1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_049463.1), [NC_023588.1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_023588.1), [NC_019416.1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_019416.1), [NC_048802.1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_048802.1), [NC_048804.1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_048804.1). This data was obtained in compressed (gzip) fasta format and placed into the raw data directory for further processing. The data was unziped and processed into a general feature format (gff) with the use of Prokka Program. Prokka is a program that rapidly annotates bacterial, archaeal and viral genomes by identifying important features in the DNA sequence and labeling them with useful information [1]. General feature format is a format that produces tab deliminated fields by line and is the require input file type for the Roary program.
